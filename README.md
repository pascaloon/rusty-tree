# Rusty Tree

This is a very simple tool to render a file tree in the terminal. It's a small personal project to familiarize myself with rust's json parsing.

**This requires a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to render glyphs properly.**

Example usages:
```
> rusty-tree.exe
> rusty-tree.exe ./src
```
